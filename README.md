# Containers
This library provides various containers. Each container has utility functions to manipulate the data it holds. This is an abstraction as to not have to manually manage and reallocate memory. 

Inspired by the C++ standard library; however, implemented using C with different function interfaces as the C++ standard library but with the same container names.

## Setup
There are two types of library files which can be generated: dynamic and static. Both ways will be described below using clang. However, the steps are the same with gcc except `clang` is to be replaced with `gcc`.

### Dynamic Library

1. Navigate to your C working directory

2. Run:
```
git clone ssh://git@github.com/bkthomps/Containers.git
cd Containers/src
```

3. To create a dynamic library, run:
```
clang -shared -o containers.so -fPIC *.c
```

4. Now, you can copy and paste the `include` directory and `containers.so` to any project that you would like to use the dynamic library with.

5. Thus, for an example program, the directory would look like this:
    * containers.so
    * include/
      * array.h
      * deque.h
      * ...
    * test.c

6. The test.c file could then contain, for example:
```
#include "include/vector.h"
```

7. And the project would be compiled with:
```
clang test.c -o test containers.so -ldl
```

### Static Library

1. Navigate to your C working directory

2. Run:
```
git clone ssh://git@github.com/bkthomps/Containers.git
cd Containers/src
```

3. To create a static library, run:
```
gcc *.c -c -fpic
ar rcs containers.a *.o
rm *.o
```

4. Now, you can copy and paste the `include` directory and `containers.a` to any project that you would like to use the static library with.

5. Thus, for an example program, the directory would look like this:
    * containers.a
    * include/
      * array.h
      * deque.h
      * ...
    * test.c

6. The test.c file could then contain, for example:
```
#include "include/vector.h"
```

7. And the project would be compiled with:
```
clang test.c -o test containers.a -ldl
```

## Container Types
The container types that this library contains are described below.

### Sequence containers
Data structures which can be accessed sequentially.
* array - static contiguous array
* vector - dynamic contiguous array
* deque - double-ended queue
* forward_list - singly-linked list
* list - doubly-linked list

### Associative containers
Data structures that can be quickly searched which use comparators.
* set - collection of unique keys, sorted by keys
* map - collection of key-value pairs, sorted by keys, keys are unique
* multiset - collection of keys, sorted by keys
* multimap - collection of key-value pairs, sorted by keys

### Unordered associative containers
Data structures that can be quickly searched which use hashing.
* unordered_set - collection of unique keys, hashed by keys
* unordered_map - collection of key-value pairs, hashed by keys, keys are unique
* unordered_multiset - collection of keys, hashed by keys
* unordered_multimap - collection of key-value pairs, hashed by keys

### Container adaptors
Data structures which adapt other containers to enhance functionality.
* stack - adapts a container to provide stack (last-in first-out)
* queue - adapts a container to provide queue (first-in first-out)
* priority_queue - adapts a container to provide priority queue
